# Important Notice Concerning GitHub Issue.
## Before reading my README.md file about my first project, I want to inform why the project has submitted the way it has been.

I encountered a problem on 29th February, quite late at night, when trying to push my commits. Git had informed me about the video files I were using to be too large which, therefore, could not be pushed. As I was not aware of this restriction Git has inplace, I immediately tried to solve the issue myself by searching online for answers. I found Git's own information support which infomed me to run git lfs uninstall and I did. However, to no avail I had to continue to research online which took me around in circles of information as Git would refuse to push my work and ended up at a scenerio which looked like this.

![Git Evidence 1](https://github.com/kctffs/perfume-aftershave2/assets/155545578/5ee2eef0-fb2e-4a9e-83ac-fd8c796e7831)

The following morning I put a request into slack on the correct Git channel but had no response from anyone. Also contacting studentcare@codeinstitute.net but unfortunatley had no immediate response. Resulting to calling, I got a phonecall back after the fifth try from a staff member where I explained the problem and was concerned for my work as I had unpushed commits that are tied to my project. It was explained to me to contact tutor support through the LMS after they suggested to message the slack community which, I had already done.

The automated chatbot did not help provide any useful help with the problem however, I got through to a human where I started to address my situation. Sharing my frustrations I was following step-by-step git commands that I was being given to, to try and resolve the problem but Git was still not letting up. It was quickly addressed to me that I had an excessive ammount of large files in Git; I had already understood from the Git messages after pushing, and was advised to remove all video files from the workspace, which I followed. Given the command `git push --force` as a suggestion still did not work so the next advice I was given was to run a command of git config pull.rebase false followed by a git pull.

 <img width="968" alt="Git Evidence 2" src="https://github.com/kctffs/perfume-aftershave2/assets/155545578/fae33863-9497-4193-9ad7-2a06307e8855"> <img width="654" alt="Git Evidence 3" src="https://github.com/kctffs/perfume-aftershave2/assets/155545578/76dd0366-bc37-4f80-a1d0-156bb4d3b2b6">

Again, had no result. My next information provided was to delete the whole directory of videos from the git repository which I followed and was the latest commit on that project.

![Git Evidence 4](https://github.com/kctffs/perfume-aftershave2/assets/155545578/378380c7-5667-4426-a125-4dfd11b6241b)

Another `git push --force` was then suggested after the deleting commit but Git would still refuse and the online tutor tech support then told me there is a large amount of web conflicts. The tutoring tech support then advised me to create a whole new repository for this project, copy and paste over the coding I had done and finalise on that workspace instead because there was no solution to my matter.

So, there is a link below this explanation to the inital workspace I had where all the original adds, commits and pushes are located for you to see and be able to go through.

    -  One more example would be to implement a mechanic to scroll through the database of past daily, weekly, monthly, yearly; winners, top trending, spotlight and watchlists.
      
## Testing.

  - Upon deployment, there was no issues regarding the reposnsiveness of Afterfume throughout the changes of screen sizes.
  - Unfortunately, now that I have had more time to check over the website, there are a couple of imperfections that could be resolved with easy fixings.
   -  One example of this is on the submission page, there is a lot more margin-bottom space than intended leaving an unnecassary amount of distance between the form and footer; the fix being to reducing the margin-bottom.
  - Navigation works really well throught the sizes, even with the hover detail over 992px.
   -  Improvement could be on the three-line bared sybmol where I would increase the size as you jump up from phone to tablet, tablet to desktop.
  - Images and videos are kindly repsonsive in sizes and work well to fit.
   -  Informative section of the index.html has two videos that are arguably too small when it reaches the 992px query.
    -   Fixing this would be as simple as increasing video height and width in css.
  - Form testing was perfect as * implied sections are required and the email will not submit without and '@' address.

  - ### Validating.   
   -  HTML validator failed first time around on every page due to a variety of misspelling and wrong measurement units; only one warning occured for a section without a heading.
    -   To resolve the misspelling issue, there was a thorough double and triple checking over the docunment, corrected as much as I saw.
    -   To resolve the issue regarding the measurement units, it was to do with the video units, and I quickly realised there was 'px' so I removed them.
    -   Finally there was an issure where I had ordered my tags the in the wrong order and this was quickly resovled.
   -  CSS Validating had no issues at all.
     
  - ### Lighthouse Report.
   -  Chrome's lighthouse report gave Afterfume's best score after three analysations to the submission page for the desktop version. Lighthouse gave the worst report for the perfume page after three.
    -   Although this is a good way to be given some feedback, because they're estimated values, I found to have a constant of different ratings after every analysation which is then untrustworthy.
    -   To resolve the performance testing next time around, I would make use of the blank space which was the main fault of the score being pulled down.

  - ### Bugs.
   -  Apart from the obvious bug I have with the orignial repository stating at the top of the document, I encountered no other bugs.
   -  Therefore, **unfixed bug** is only resulting in the bug I and Tutor tech support could not solve.
     
  - ### Deployment.
   -  Both Aftefume projects were deployed using GitHub and this was completed by:
   -  Starting in the GitHub repository, opening up the settings tab.
   -  On the far left, selecting the sub-catagory of *Pages*.
   -  Selecting the dropdown menu in the *Branch* catagory and choosing *Main*.
   -  After selecting this catagory, GitHub will refresh and provide a deployment catagory on the far right of your repository.
